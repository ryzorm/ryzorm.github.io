<h2 id="testing-to-see-if-someone-is-a-worker">Testing to See If Someone Is a <span class="work">Worker</span></h2>
<p>See if they have <strong><span class="work">Waylock</span></strong>:
People with <span class="work">waylock</span> are not able to change how they feel about something, even if they have good reasons. They won’t even try things a different <em>way</em> just to see how it goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see them struggling to try to feel a different way about something (like fear of heights) and they are unable to, then you know they may be closer to a <span class="work">Worker</span> or a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>. </li>
<li>If you see them understanding that there are good reasons to change how they feel, but they stay the same, then you know they may be a <span class="work">Worker</span> or a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>.</li>
<li>If they are unwilling to feel a different way about something just to try and see how it goes, then you know they may be a <span class="work">Worker</span> or a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>.</li>
<li>If they are sad about having <span class="work">Waylock</span>, they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span>. </li>
<li>If they come up with strange and complicated excuses to get out of thinking about things a different way, then they probably have <span class="work">Waylock</span> and might be a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> or a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more ways to see if someone is a <span class="work">Worker</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If their days are mostly <strong>work</strong>, <strong>fun</strong>, and <strong>rest</strong>, they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
<li>If you would have to get good at things that <strong>don’t</strong> help you make the world a more thriving place, in order to spend quality time with them, then they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
<li>You can try things their way to see if the outcomes are good or bad. If you try to demonstrate that an outcome is bad, a <span class="work">Worker</span> won’t be interested in knowing, or they won’t understand what you’re trying to show them.</li>
<li>If you have never heard them use words of any kind to describe their negative qualities when talking to others, then they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
<li>If they seem very happy and content to talk about very small scale things with their friends, then they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
<li>If you notice their meaning of “be good” is a little different from yours. Yours is something like, “Live up to your potential to be independent and knowledgeable enough to be helpful to the world.” If theirs is something like, “Take care of objects, make sure things look nice, and don’t do things that upset me,” then they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span> or <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>.</li>
<li>If they don’t feel responsible for the effect their ways would have on the world around them if lots of people do things that way, then they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
<li>If they do things that they cannot explain easily and don’t know where they came from, then they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-out-they-are-a-worker">Finding Out They Are a <span class="work">Worker</span></h3>
<p>Now you know that lots of things they say and do aren’t very carefully thought through or planned ahead of time.</p>
<p>Now you know it’s OK to do things that would impress someone else.</p>
<p>Now you know you can’t trust them to respond well to all your actions. Now you will have to think about what to do or say if they respond poorly to something you bring up.</p>
<p>Now you know it’s OK to defy the <span class="work">Worker’s</span> way and not treat others how a <span class="work">Worker</span> treated you when you used to believe in them.</p>
<p>Now you know it’s OK to think only a little bit about their advice or words.</p>
<p>Don’t expect them to be willing to take turns trying other ways. They would not feel in your debt if you helped them see the effect of their ways on yourself. Their ways may not be their own, so they don’t care.</p>
<h3 id="finding-out-they-are-not-a-worker-but-a-pretending-person-misguided-person-or-bad-guy">Finding Out They Are Not a <span class="work">Worker</span>, But a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>, <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span>, or <span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></h3>
<p>Now you know that their ability to figure out how much control they should have over what other people do with their time has been damaged. They may continue to try to have more and more control over other people&#39;s time. Nothing inside them can tell them to stop. They must rely on others to convince them to stop. They might have a very hard time realizing how much suffering and damage they have the potential to cause. </p>

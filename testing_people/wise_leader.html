<h2 id="testing-to-see-if-someone-is-a-wise-leader">Testing to See If Someone Is a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span></h2>
<p>See how <strong><span class="wise">Pocobian</span></strong> they are by communicating in unconventional ways:</p>
<p><strong><span class="wise">Pocobian</span></strong>: A quality of a person who thinks very hard about the <strong>p</strong>erson <strong>o</strong>ne <strong>co</strong>uld <strong>b</strong>e. They are someone who asks themselves, “If I were being taken care of, could I think of any messages so important, that it would be worthwhile upsetting the person I am now for just a chance to communicate it?” and tends to come up with good answers. They use these answers to further guide their actions. </p>
<p>If you have used up all the words you can think of to try to communicate with them that something is discouraging you, or would create a bad future if it continued, you can treat someone as if they are very <span class="wise">Pocobian</span>. If someone isn’t good at thinking of good answers, you know they are not a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. A <span class="learn">Learner</span> could imagine there could be an answer, but currently needs to think about themselves, so that they may become a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> someday. <span class="work">Workers</span> are not very good at thinking about that kind of stuff. A <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> might do some very unexpected things, like being very confident that you want to be bad and therefore be treated like a bad person.</p>
<p>&#42; Since there are so few <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span> in the world, you should only use this test if you have a plan of what to do if they fail the test as poorly as a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> would. You should never trust anyone to pass this test without a backup plan! A real <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>, <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>, or <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong> would <em>not</em> be disappointed in you if you didn’t trust them. They would be happy that you are so willing to do good that you put some thought into what to do if they let you down!</p>
<p>Here are some more ways to work out if someone is a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> would realize they are responsible for however you treat them. Here’s a test: Try to impress them by treating them as they treated you. If they don’t like it, then you know they aren’t <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>. In that case, you may have discovered a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> or a <span class="work">Worker</span>.</li>
<li>When it comes to those who lead others, you might hear them complain about how difficult being in charge is. They blame the people they’re in charge of for being wrong or broken, before they wonder what they could do to improve themselves. They might be heard saying how real <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span> are lucky their subjects behave so well, without wondering what they themselves are doing wrong. They’re definitely not <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>. Probably just a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>. </li>
<li>If there is an unfortunate incident in which you know you are innocent, you can figure out what kind of person you are dealing with by acting sorry anyway. If they still try to figure out what happened, then they may be <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. If they decide to punish you without trying to figure out what happened, then you know they might be a <span class="work">Worker</span> or a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>.</li>
<li>If they don’t understand something that you are making progress in, but try to stop you anyway, then they are not a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.</li>
<li>If they accept a lot of the credit for something you succeeded in by yourself, then you know they are not a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. They could be a <span class="learn">Learner</span> or <span class="work">Worker</span> who thinks the person giving credit is an <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong> (they are thinking, “Since they gave me credit, it must be true”). They could also be a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> who thinks they deserve as much credit as possible.</li>
<li>If they can&#39;t tell you why they do everything they do when you ask them, and they are sorry about it, then they might be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.</li>
<li>If you demonstrate how committed you are to them and their cause to do good, a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> will see it and try to find a way to tell you that they aren’t actually that great.</li>
<li>If they don’t like it when they see you pretend to be happy around them, they might be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.</li>
<li>If they want you to tell them when you would prefer to be left alone, they might be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.</li>
<li>If you see them use their advantages to help others, then they might be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="finding-out-they-are-a-wise-leader">Finding Out They Are a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span></h3>
<p>Now you know it’s OK to do things that will impress them because it will help build a better future for everyone. </p>
<h3 id="finding-out-they-are-not-a-wise-leader">Finding Out They Are Not a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span></h3>
<p>Now you know they may not remember how they treated you or what effect it has on you. They might not realize it was a mistake. You should plan what you do next, considering they might not remember or say they are sorry. They may not tell their <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> friends what mistake they discovered, in order to keep others from experiencing the same damage they gave you.</p>
<p>Now you know that they might not use their advantages for good. You should not expect them to use their advantages to help others without those advantages. You now know it&#39;s not OK to put a lot of energy into giving them more advantages. If something makes them happy and you don’t see how it would help them do good, then it&#39;s not worth the energy spent in trying to get it to them.</p>
<p>Additionally, now you know that no matter how many things you eliminate from the world that upset them, they probably won’t use their extra time not being upset to see things your way, play with you, help others, or improve themselves. They will probably just find more things to get upset about! Now you also know that eliminating things that upset them might not even be good for the world.</p>
<p>Now you know they may not be smart enough to realize that they don’t know you very well. They probably won’t give you good advice on what to do with your time. If you suspect some of their advice may <em>not</em> help you develop into someone better able to do good, you might be right.</p>
<p>Remember, you may want to rethink some ways you checkboxed as good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing things this way is good because a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> acted confidently when they did things this way.</li>
<li>Doing things this way is good because a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> copied it from someone else they trust as a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.</li>

<h1 id="how-many-to-bother-with-your-problems-">How Many to Bother With Your Problems?</h1>
<p>Most of the time, you should treat everyone the best you can. Imagine you have enough food to share with four people. Three of them are <span class="learn">Learners</span>, and one is a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong> behind bars in jail. You should still let the <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong> have the food because they can’t hurt anyone and there is enough for everyone.</p>
<p>Sometimes there aren’t enough resources for everyone. This world isn’t currently set up to make everyone comfortable. Now you need to decide: how many <span class="misguide">Misguided People</span> should you upset to make a <span class="learn">Learner</span> happy? How many <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guys</span></strong> should you take time to help, over a person who is Pretending? </p>
<p>Usually, <span class="work">Workers</span>, <span class="learn">Learners</span>, and <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span> follow these guidelines
(but there may be lots of other things to consider when making decisions):</p>
<p>The “4s Guideline”: How many of a certain type of person is it OK to upset?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you had to choose between respecting a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> or four Pretend <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>, you would choose the <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.</li>
<li>If four <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span> were playing, it’s OK for one or more <span class="learn">Learners’</span> play to interrupt the play of the <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>.</li>
<li>If 16 <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> were playing, it’s OK for one or more <span class="learn">Learners’</span> play to interrupt the play of the <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span>.</li>

<li>If up to 64 <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knowers</span></strong> were having a normal meeting, it would be OK for one hungry child to interrupt their meeting to ask for some food.</li>
</ul>


<p>These are just guidelines. That means you shouldn&#39;t follow them closely all the time. Here are some things that may also be acceptable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep on doing things that would upset a <span class="work">Worker</span>, but would make a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> feel welcome and trusted.</li>
<li>Frustrate more than 16 <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> for a <span class="learn">Learner</span>.</li>
<li>Four <span class="learn">Learners</span> switching to a quiet game so a tired <span class="work">Worker</span> can rest more peacefully.</li>
<li>A <span class="learn">Learner</span> trying hard not to disturb a <span class="work">Worker</span> who needs to focus on helping their boss, who is a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. They are doing something very important that could do a lot of good.</li>
<li>Not playing near a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> who is known to hurt your ability to do good if you upset them too much with your play.</li>
<li>Let two <span class="learn">Learners</span> upset 40 <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span>, if the only way to stop them is to hurt them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#42;<span class="guider">Self Guiders</span> and <span class="wise">Wise Leaders’</span> life mission is to help others, so bad or inconvenient things that happen to them don’t bother them too much. Things that truly upset a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> or <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> are things that affect many others. You should pay attention not to do anything that would upset them in a way that affects others. Upsetting them could mean many innocent people also get upset. But, don’t worry too much, they are very good at communicating <strong>boundaries</strong> and when it&#39;s OK for you to take up their time.</p>
<p><span class="work">Workers</span> often get confused about what to put energy into. Sometimes, they would readily upset lots of <span class="learn">Learners</span> just to make themselves feel a little better. Other times, they would give a great deal of time and energy to help just one <span class="learn">Learner</span> a little bit. To be nice to them, you should make sure you only ask them for help with things that would really help you become your best. They can’t tell what would help you and what wouldn’t.</p>
<figure class = "floatright" style="width:450px;">
  <img  width="450" src="images/17_unconfortable.png" alt="On the left, a child holds a bloody scrape on her arm.  A voice says the child should have said something, of cource they would have helped. On the right a child hold up her foot that has been squished in a shoe. A voice is yelling that she should stop whining about her feet.">
  <figcaption>A <span class="learn">Learner</span> is seen with an injury on her arm. A <span class="work">Worker</span> overly reassures the <span class="learn">Learner</span> that she can ask the <span class="work">Worker</span> for help whenever she feels bad. A bit later, the <span class="learn">Learner</span> is wearing shoes that are too tight and are hurting her feet. She comes to the <span class="work">Worker</span> for help, but the <span class="work">Worker</span> yells at her instead of helping.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="work">Workers</span> are also very confusing regarding when they think you should ask for help and when not. They might get upset if you don’t tell them when something is making you a bit uncomfortable, but when you tell them something is making you <em>very</em> uncomfortable, they might get mad or upset at you for complaining about it. Sometimes, their ways can be very unpredictable, and they don’t realize it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> and <span class="misguide">Misguided People</span> may act very upset if they don’t get to have an experience they want. But even if they did get their way, it would not benefit them. Unlike <span class="learn">Learners</span>, who improve when they have an experience and learn from the result, <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> and <span class="misguide">Misguided People</span> have a very hard time learning new things. That is why many people think it is better to help a <span class="learn">Learner</span> have an experience they want <em>over</em> someone who is <span class="pretend">Pretending</span> or a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span>.</p>
<p>Sometimes, <span class="pretend">Pretending</span> or <span class="misguide">Misguided People</span> may act distressed, as though there was a real emergency, if they don’t get their way. You might find them acting like it’s not their fault at all when they poorly communicate the difference between an actual emergency and not getting their way, and someone gets hurt because of it. They will probably say something like: “You should have listened.”
An example: A <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> yelling at you when you are testing your balance on a wooden plank, and then later yelling the same way when you are walking behind a car that starts moving. You might ignore them because you have known them to get distressed about stuff that isn’t actually important.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: On another piece of paper, write down the unfilled guidelines of how many of each type of person it’s OK to upset if you are a <span class="learn">Learner</span>:</p>
<p><strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong>      64</p>
<p><span class="guider">Self Guider</span>  <span class = "blank">       </span></p>
<p><span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>  <span class = "blank">       </span></p>
<p><span class="learn">Learner</span>        1</p>
<p><span class="work">Worker</span>            4</p>
<p><span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>  <span class = "blank">       </span></p>
<p><span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> <span class = "blank">       </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>        256</p>
<div class = "upsidown">
<p>Answers:
Everything Knower: 64, Self Guider :16,  Wise Leader: 4,  Learner: 1, Worker: 4, Pretending Person: 16, Misguided Person: 64, Bad Guy: 256</p>
</div>
<p><em>Becoming a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> is hard and takes time, but it is worthwhile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: You are a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>. You and your 13 <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> friends are trying to play a game of throwing a football in a field and are complaining about everyone. Three young <span class="learn">Learners</span> are trying to play a game in that same area and are upsetting your game. You really want to play your game. Here are some options you have:</p>
<ol type= "A">
<li>Yell at them to go away.</li>
<li>Work on making the field nicer (mowing the grass, painting lines, caring for trees) so they see and go away.</li>
<li>Hold a meeting with your friends and start talking about important stuff so the <span class="learn">Learners</span> don’t upset you.</li>
</ol>

<p>On another piece of paper, fill in the blanks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which option is the easiest for you? <span class = "blank">       </span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Which option would make <span class="learn">Learners</span> think it’s OK to take things from those younger than them? <span class = "blank">       </span></p>

<li><p>Which option will help the <span class="learn">Learners</span> learn <span class="work">Worker</span> skills if they watch? <span class = "blank">       </span></p>

<p>Exercise 3: You are a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> trying to take care of a young group of <span class="learn">Learners</span>. You <em>really</em> want them to pay attention to what you have to say, but they are not. Here are some options you have:</p>
<ol type ="A">
    <li>Believe that they are not smart enough to know that you are worth listening to, and try to convince them they are not smart, so they will listen.</li>
    <li>Yell really loudly and get angry to frighten them into listening to you.</li>
    <li>Try to become a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> and wait until they are comfortable enough to give you another chance to be heard.</li>
    <li>Want something else besides having them pay attention to you.</li>
</ol>

<p>On another piece of paper, fill in the blanks:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which option will take the longest? <span class = "blank">       </span></p>

<h2 id="when-caretakers-take-away-things-you-really-need">When Caretakers Take Away Things You Really Need</h2>
<p>If you and your friends are <span class="learn">Learners</span> on the path to becoming <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span> to do lots of good someday, you may need lots of resources and experiences to play around with, to get a whole understanding of the world. Sometimes when you go for a particular experience, a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> says you can’t because it is bad, and you are bad for trying to experience it. They also may try to create punishments so that you are <strong>impelled</strong> from doing it. They don’t tell you why it’s bad, and it’s also very easy to see that they are mistaken. Even if it was bad for one of the <span class="learn">Learners</span>, it could still help the others be the best <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> they could be someday. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking to your friends about something more important than what a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> wants you to talk about.</li>
<li>Playing with your friends.</li>
<li>Solving problems in new ways.</li>
<li>Playing with an old tire.</li>
<li>Playing in the mud.</li>
<li>Reading about how the world works. </li>
<li>Listening in on how caretakers secretly talk to each other about problems you’ve created.</li>
<li>Wiggling around.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have some options on ways to approach what they are doing to you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mourning Approach</strong>: Enduring the loss of this resource or experience and still trying to continue along the path of a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> who will one day do good.</li>
<li><strong>Sneaky Approach</strong>: Trying to keep on having the experience by sneaking around, but still intending to be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> to do good.</li>
<li><strong>Enforce Approach</strong>: Trying to stop other people using this resource or experience to impress the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> enough that they will: 
 a. Come to you for advice and you can finally tell them, “Hmm, I think this way wasn’t for the best and was actually really discouraging.”
 b. Help them see how the end result of their actions did not make for a thriving environment.
 c. Make you the new leader so you can get rid of their way.</li>
 <figure  style="width:550px;">
  <img width = "550" src="../../../images/41_wiggle_jail.png" alt="An angry adult holds the hand of a silly child. They are standing in front of a no wiggle sign. The adult is pointing to a jail full of wiggely kids. Another adult is sad and saying that the jail is full, and wonders what to do next." >
  <figcaption>The <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> banned wiggling around and being silly for some reason they won’t share. So many <span class="learn">Learners</span> have broken the rule and filled the jail for wiggle kids that the <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> will hopefully consider rethinking having this rule in the first place.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<li><strong>Deviant Approach</strong> (sometimes called rebelling): Sacrificing your potential to be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> and do the most good in exchange for helping future <span class="learn">Learners</span> who wish to be <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>. Change yourself into someone who enjoys this experience. Force the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> to get overwhelmed with trying to stop people from having this experience and have the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> finally realize it was a bad idea to ban it.</li>
</ol>

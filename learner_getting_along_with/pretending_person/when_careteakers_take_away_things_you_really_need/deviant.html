<h3 id="ins-and-outs-of-the-deviant-approach">Ins and Outs of the Deviant Approach</h3>
<p>Giving up your potential to do good so others can is a great sacrifice. Perhaps, if enough people use the Deviant Approach, the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> will be overwhelmed with trying to create difficulties to forcefully impel you to stop, so they have to give up. Unfortunately, people who look up to you and think you’re a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> will wonder why you are the kind of person who really really likes this way. It might be difficult to say, “I’m not a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>. I’m just doing it to help a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> realize their mistake in thinking it’s bad.”</p>
<p><span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> do not typically think in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Wow! They would give up all their potential just to try to communicate something important to me, maybe… maybe I should listen.” </li>
<li><p>“Oh no, if I hadn’t called them bad for doing that all those years ago, they might have become a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> and have done lots of good – whoops.”</p>
<p>They usually think in terms of: </p>
</li>
<li>“Look at what they have become from doing that thing. Oh no, I should have tried harder to stop them from doing it in the first place!”</li>
<li>“Hmm, they must be dumb to see it as not good. I will have to force them not to do it.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, many people who take this option forget they took it to help <span class="learn">Learners</span> reach their potential to be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. They also sometimes end up choosing ways that hurt <span class="learn">Learners</span>. They overdo it with liking the experience so much and teasing <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> with it so much, that they end up teasing everyone, even <span class="learn">Learners</span>!</p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong>: Write down your answers to these questions on another piece of paper.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Say a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> doesn&#39;t like it when a <span class="learn">Learner</span> tells on other <span class="learn">Learners</span> when they break one of their rules. Which way to handle it would they probably NEVER think of on their own, no matter how much you believe in them?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>They give the <span class="learn">Learner</span> telling on other <span class="learn">Learners</span> the <strong>negative label</strong> of “tattle tail,” and get mad at them and try to make them feel bad.</li>
<li>They admit to the <span class="learn">Learner</span> that they are a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>, and tell them that means it’s OK to <strong>not</strong> spread their ways to others. They would say they are sorry for tricking you and try to make things right.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Imagine you are the leader of a large group of people. One day, you decide to make a random rule without giving them a reason why. What will happen?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>They will accept your rule and follow it very closely.</li>
<li>They will break the rule and tease you about it.</li>
<li>They will break the rule secretly.</li>
<li>They will try to stop others who break the rule.</li>
<li>All of the above.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Say you never share the reason you made something against the rules with the people you lead, no matter how much they demonstrate they believe in you?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>More people will keep on following you closely.</li>
<li>More people will lose hope in you and break the rule.</li>
<li>Things will stay the same.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What will happen if you tell the people who enforce the rule you are proud of them, and they really helped you. Now they deserve to know the <strong>true</strong> reason for the rule and you will listen to their ideas.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Most will accept your correct judgment and praise.</li>
<li>Most will be surprised because they were doing it to avoid getting in trouble. They were not trying to do the right thing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What will happen if you tell the people who break the rule you are proud of them, and they should not follow rules that don’t make sense without a reason. Now you will listen to their ideas.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Most will accept your correct judgment and praise.</li>
<li>Most will be surprised because they were being naughty to make you mad for fun, and they were not really trying to do the right thing.</li>
</ol>

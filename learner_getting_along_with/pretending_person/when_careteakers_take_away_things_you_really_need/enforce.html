<h3 id="ins-and-outs-of-the-enforce-approach">Ins and Outs of the Enforce Approach</h3>
<p>You should probably not take this approach. <span class="pretend">Pretending People’s</span> ways are usually not worth spreading. If you do, now you have to be an enforcer of their way. You will have to do things that will knowingly harm people&#39;s potential so that you can impress the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saying, “Oh that makes sense,” when the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> tells you their way (even before you understand it and compare it to many other ways).</li>
<li>Saying, “Everyone who doesn’t see this is the right way is dumb – ha ha,” when the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> tells you their way.</li>
<li>Saying, “If you don’t understand this way is the best, well, it&#39;s probably too complicated for you,” when someone asks you why you act like the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> (even though the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> didn’t put as much thought into it as a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>).</li>
<li>Saying something like, “Obviously, even a baby could see this is the right way,” when someone asks you why you act like the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> (even though smart and good people might come up with different ways that might also be good ideas).</li>
<li>Making things difficult by forcefully impelling others from using other ways.</li>
<li>Telling on the <span class="learn">Learners</span> who performed the banned action, so the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> can try to forcefully impel them to discourage them.</li>
<li><strong>Viewing</strong> people who use other ways as <strong>less than</strong> people who do things the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person&#39;s</span> way.</li>
<li>Using unconventional ways to communicate or teasing, when people try the banned way.</li>
</ul>
<p>These might work if the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> is like a Scientist. A Scientist would accept the results of an experiment on people to see if it harmed them, but they would need to make sure everyone was trying it that way so they got accurate results. <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> do not keep track of their ways to see if they harm people.</p>
<p>These also might work if the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> matched everyone&#39;s effort and faith in the enforcing of their ways into imagining how their subjects feel when useful experiences are kept from them. Then they would realize their ways are discouraging. Unfortunately, <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> are not able to think like that anymore.</p>
<p>If they truly are a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>, then you know they <strong>need help</strong> before your attempts to make an impression on them have any effect. Before they get the help they need, they will not ask you for advice, imagine how their subjects feel, or keep track of the effects of their ways.</p>
<p>Even if the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> did ask your advice, many people who follow this path forget what they wanted to say or how to say it (how to talk about <strong>ways</strong> mostly hasn&#39;t been invented yet). So, if you tell the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>, “I don’t think this way is for the best,” and they ask, “Which way?” you will be unable to communicate which way you mean.</p>
<p>Many people who take the Enforce Approach think the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> is testing their commitment to their way, so they continue to support the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person’s</span> way.</p>
<p>Even if you are dedicated enough for the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> to choose you as the new leader, many new leaders forget what they were going to do, because they have put so much energy into the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person’s</span> way. It may have been many many years ago, and now they have completely forgotten their own way.</p>

<h2 id="talking-to-friends-about-pretending-people">Talking to Friends About <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span></h2>
<p>Don’t call someone “a pretender” if you discover they are a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>. They are not <span class="wise">Pocobian</span> like a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>, so they will not understand your meaning. To them, it would feel the same as when someone calls you bad, when you are just trying your best. </p>
<p>It’s important to speak about them in the way you would like to be spoken about too. Example conversation:</p>
<p>Kid 1: “I think they might be pretending to know everything.”
Kid 2: “I think they might be pretending to guide themselves.”
Kid 3: “I think they might be pretending to be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>.”</p>
<p>Kid 1: “When I discovered they didn’t know something, instead of admitting it, they tried to hide it.”</p>
<p>Kid 2: “When I found that they were not very talented at something I asked them to help me with, and I couldn’t have known they weren’t able, they called me dumb for not knowing they weren’t talented in it.”</p>
<p>Kid 3: “When it seemed clear they forgot something they did to me, they acted like they remembered.”</p>
<p>Kid 2: “Are you sure they are not a <span class="learn">Learner</span> trying a different way?”</p>
<p>Kid 1: “I don’t know. Maybe we need to be together more.”</p>
<p>Kid 3: “If they are a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span>, why do you think they are one?”</p>
<p>Kid 2: “Well, it&#39;s not because they are bad. Maybe it&#39;s because that is all they know.”</p>
<p>Kid 1: “Maybe they are afraid that if they were honest with us, that we wouldn&#39;t listen to them?”</p>
<p>Kid 3: “Maybe something really bad happened to them when they were little with someone they thought was a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>.”</p>

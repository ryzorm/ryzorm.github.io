<p><span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> like to lie about why a rule is there, or make up a reason on the spot. Even if you change your job to prove that they are wrong, they may just make up a different reason. The real reason is that they are not a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> and are uncomfortable thinking about how the world would work if that rule was gone. They have never heard of anyone that was in charge of them changing their mind. They don&#39;t know if it’s OK to defy their caretaker’s way. They will not bring your proof to their boss or rule maker, and will not suggest a new way.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Say you ask a caretaker why there is a rule. What they tell you doesn’t sound quite right. You decide to go about proving them wrong. On another piece of paper, match what happens to the type of person you would meet.</p>

<h2 id="communicating-with-pretending-people-based-on-the-damage-they-cause-you">Communicating With <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> Based on the Damage They Cause You</h2>
<p>You can keep the damage they cause your mind, like how you would with a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. You can walk around feeling awkward, sad, or hurt. Maybe if someone else notices, they can talk to the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> about their ways and what to change. That way, if you keep on being hurt, you will eventually help others not to be hurt in the future. It seems like a very good and selfless thought to give up your future to help the future of others.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this world, scientists and other people in charge are just starting to collect information on how treating other people affects them (like measuring how treating or caring for kids a certain way affects the success of a whole school or a whole country!). But, currently, most people ask “What’s wrong with them?” instead of asking “What happened or keeps happening to them to make them act like that?”. If you think that there isn’t any information being collected about how you are treated and what effect it has, maybe you should not keep the damage.</li>
<li>Also, in this world, it is very common to encounter people who are <span class="pretend">Pretending</span> to be leaders. If you keep the damage they cause you as a way of asking for help, it’s unlikely that anyone will understand what ways the <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> used on you. People who <span class="pretend">Pretend</span> also do not like it when others question their ways. If it&#39;s not against the law, they will probably keep doing it anyway. Even if it is against the law in one place, some <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> might move to another place rather than rethink their way!</li>
<li>It&#39;s nice that a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> can experience the unpleasant results of their own actions. Unfortunately, they are <strong>just not smart enough</strong> to connect your behavior with something they did to you in the past.</li>
<li>If someone very young sees you with the damage they gave you – and they think you are a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> – they will believe it’s OK to think and act like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering these ideas, it might be more selfless and good to try to recover from the damage <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> give you, instead of keeping it. Although it might be <em>very upsetting</em> to hear that a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> feels like they are responsible for your success if you do succeed, you might have to think of something to say to them if they do.</p>

<h3 id="communicating-concepts-in-other-ways">Communicating Concepts in Other Ways</h3>
<p>You might think most people would rethink things that make them feel overwhelmed, but <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> are not really the ones to do that.</p>

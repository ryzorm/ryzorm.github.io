<h1 id="how-a-learner-could-get-along-with-a-misguided-person">How a <span class="learn">Learner</span> Could Get Along With a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span></h1>
<p>If they try to force you to act in a bad way, you should resist.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if they talk to you, they might try to do something that would make you forget the person you want to be or change you into someone else. They might use tricks, and say things like, “I used to feel the same way,” or ask, “Are you chicken?” </p>
<p>Examples:
<span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don’t want to smoke a cigarette.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: &quot;Oh, I used to say the same thing. Then I tried it and everything was better.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don’t want to spy on people.”</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “Oh, what are you? Chicken?”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don’t want to swim in that abandoned mine.”</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “Don’t you want to be <span class="guider">Verse</span> like a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>? You gotta try everything once.” </p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don&#39;t want to boss these little kids around and hit them if they misbehave.”</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “Don&#39;t worry; that&#39;s what they want you to do. They deserve it.”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Wow, this wrench tool is really new to me. I better be very careful when handling it until I’m more confident with it.“</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “What are you? A baby? Ha ha.”</p>
<p>Perhaps a way to talk to them would be to say ways (or principles) that a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>, <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>, or <span class="knower">Everything Knower</span> would think are important and perhaps worth spreading, or even worth fighting for.</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don’t want to smoke a cigarette.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span>: &quot;Oh, I used to say the same thing, then I tried it and everything was better.&quot; </p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Hmm, that’s something to think about. OK, maybe I will <strong>try it when I’m ready</strong>, but that could take a long time.” (Probably never.)</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don’t want to spy on people.”</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “Oh, what are you? Chicken?”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “No, I just think <strong>people should not be seen if they don’t want to be</strong>.”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don’t want to swim in that abandoned mine.”</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “Don’t you want to be <span class="guider">Verse</span> like a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>? You gotta try everything once.” </p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Yea, but if something goes wrong, I could die. I think people <strong>deserve to live</strong>.”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Sorry, I don&#39;t want to boss these little kids around and hit them if they misbehave.”</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “Don&#39;t worry; that&#39;s what they want you to do. They deserve it.”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “I think people <strong>deserve to be free</strong>. Maybe I could get them to behave in a <strong>peaceful</strong> way.”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “Wow, this wrench tool is really new to me. I better be very careful when handling it until I’m more confident with it.“</p>
<p><span class="misguide">Them</span>: “What are you? A baby? Ha ha.”</p>
<p><span class="learn">You</span>: “No, I just think people should get a chance to <strong>learn things at their own pace</strong>.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, you don’t even need to tell them a reason, you just have to think it and then tell them something like: “Naw, I don’t want to do that, sounds really boring. Think I’ll go do something else. Later.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, they act like they didn’t hear you, act like you said you agreed to do what they wanted, or try to tell you how easy it would be to do what they want. You may have to <strong>repeat yourself many times,</strong> saying something like, “Well, as I just told you,” then say what you said before, or tell them that your values are still the same since the last time they tried to convince you. </p>
<p>If they have been a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> for a long time, saying things like this might not work. You might have to say some things you learned in the chapter about how to get along with other <span class="learn">Learners</span>, in the section about what to do if you want to be left alone.<u><a href="learner/threats_and_conflict.html#alone"> Click here to go there</a></u>. It covers options related to telling someone you want to be alone: negotiating with them, admitting your limits, telling them what kind of people you spend time with, threatening them, making fun of them, getting help, ignoring them, and using violence.</p>
<p>Spending a lot of time being cared for by a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> is unpleasant, to say the least. They hit, shout, call you names, use <strong>Care Control Reasons</strong>, and stare at you waiting until you do what they say. This can leave you confused and end up changing you into someone you don’t want to be. Some people might make an imaginary world inside their head to escape life with a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> – once they are on their own, they won’t be changed into another <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span>. </p>
<p>Sometimes, living in an imaginary world for so long can cause some problems, but may certainly be better than becoming another <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span>!</p>
<p>If you know that you live in a part of the world that recognizes a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person’s</span> ways as bad, you should find someone else to care for you. You can ask a <span class="work">Worker</span> for help (especially <span class="work">Workers</span> whose job it is to care for young <span class="learn">Learners</span>). You can tell them what&#39;s happening and they will ask you questions, and maybe get you some help. In this world, it is currently not recognized as bad to be a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span>.</p>

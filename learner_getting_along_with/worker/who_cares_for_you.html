<h2 id="a-worker-who-cares-for-you">A <span class="work">Worker</span> Who Cares for You</h2>
<p>If a <span class="work">Worker</span> is caring for you, and it’s their job, how do you tell them their ways aren’t working and let them know other ways might be worth trying? You would have to consider their <strong>Boss</strong>. Their boss has control over what the <span class="work">Worker</span> does with their time, and can make up punishments so <span class="work">Workers</span> are <strong>impelled</strong> by the boss to keep doing what the boss wants.</p>
<p>If their boss is a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>, there are lots of things that would convince them to change their ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>If they see that a way is not making the environment thrive.</li>
<li>They test to see how one way makes a thriving environment compared to another way, and choose the best one.</li>
<li>Lots of people try unconventional ways of communicating how a way hinders their ability to do good and be their best (sometimes called a rebellion or starting a revolution).</li>
<li>They can see their <span class="work">Workers</span> are discouraged in a meeting and talk about how to make them not so discouraged. </li>
</ul>
<p>If their boss is a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> or a <span class="work">Worker</span>, then there are only certain things that will convince them to change their way:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they get ordered to give it a try or else they will get fired.</li>
<li>If a lot of people who give them money are complaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a <span class="work">Worker</span> will “try” to stop you from doing something you both know is healthy and helps you to become a better person, like helping the <span class="work">Worker</span> sweep the floor, or training for an emergency situation by jumping off a tall thing. They don’t actually stop you, however, and instead let you do it. Their boss has made a <strong>Rule</strong> that they should stop people like you from doing that action, even though anyone who knows you <em>knows</em> that you are able to handle it. You have to watch them closely to see if they are telling you not to do something because it’s their job. If you tell other people the <span class="work">Worker</span> let you do that healthy activity when they should have stopped you, the <span class="work">Worker</span> may get in trouble with their boss. They will probably not realize that you are trying to help them understand that, since nothing went wrong, it might be good to let you and others do it in the future.</p>

<figure  style="width:650px;">
  <img width = "650" src="../../images/39_wink.png" alt="On the left panel, a adult stands with their arm out trying to stop a child.  The child wants to enter fun land called Bananas. A sign says kids have to be 7 years old to have fun. The adult is saying sorry.  On the right panel the adult leans over to tie their shoe, and is seen winking.  The child is seen entering the fun land." >
  <figcaption>A <span class="work">Worker</span> acts like they are trying to stop a <span class="learn">Learner</span> from coming into a fun land. A rule says they are too young to come in, so it seems like they are following the rules. The <span class="work">Worker</span> looks away and winks at the <span class="learn">Learner</span> as if to say the <span class="learn">Learner</span> could come in if they want to because following the rules this time won’t make for a better world.
</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Whoever made the rule might not be an <strong>Everything Knower</strong>, <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>, <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>, or even a <span class="learn">Learner</span>. They might be a <span class="work">Worker</span> or even someone who is Pretending! If anything bad were to happen from you doing the act anyway, the <strong>Boss or Rule Maker</strong> would hear about it. They would be mad at the <span class="work">Worker</span> who was caring for you. If more bad things happened, the <span class="work">Worker</span> could lose their job and not have money to afford food or a home. If something good happened when you did the act that helped you achieve your potential and do good in the future, the Rule Maker would not hear about it and may not even care, since lots of Bosses are <span class="work">Workers</span> or <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span>.</p>
<p>Disappointingly, the <span class="work">Worker</span> would not be rewarded, nor would they have helped to influence the future decisions of the Rule Maker if something really good had actually come about from your action. Bosses are usually <span class="work">Workers</span> or <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> so they won’t be interested anyway.</p>

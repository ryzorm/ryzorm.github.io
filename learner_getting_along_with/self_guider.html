<h1 id="how-a-learner-could-get-along-with-a-self-guider">How a <span class="learn">Learner</span> Could Get Along With a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span></h1>
<p>Getting along with a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> is also easy. You can try to communicate to them in lots of different ways, and they can understand. You can try to treat them how you want them to treat you, and they will understand and try to treat you the same. You can even think about them how you want them to think about <em>you</em>, and they can do that too!</p>
<p>Everything they do is something they like. If you do it too, you will impress them, and they will try to put as much energy into doing something you like.</p>
<p>You can demonstrate how much you believe in them and are committed to their cause, and they will have some good ideas on how to direct your energy to do the most good.</p>
<p>You can copy things they do that you don’t understand yet, in order to communicate to them that you still believe they are <span class="guider">Enoutable</span> (they do everything for a good reason). That way, they will know you still believe in them.</p>
<p>If you have found a problem with a way they use, you can communicate it to them. If you make a good argument, they might be convinced to change their mind right away. </p>
<p>Sometimes you might think: “I’m uncertain about whether their way is for the best, and when I tried it, it certainly wasn’t. Oh! Maybe their way didn’t work because I didn’t believe in it enough.” If you completely forget your way and do things their way (believing in it 100%), it will either work and everything will be fine, or they will notice it failed despite all of your hard work, and offer to try things another way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one like that exists. You should never believe in someone else&#39;s way 100%! In addition to not knowing the basics of how to do things other ways, they might not even be smart enough to realize that other ways exist. You may never meet someone to bring you back to your old ways. It may be better to remember things your way, even if it’s really hard.</p>

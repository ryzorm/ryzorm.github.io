<h1 id="playing-with-you">Playing With You</h1>
<p>An <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong> or a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> who cares for you will want to play with you and they will know how. </p>
<p>A <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> or a <span class="learn">Learner</span> who cares for you will want to play with you and try things your way. They will want to play for you both to discover each other&#39;s limits and weaknesses. They might not be very good at it, but it doesn&#39;t bother them to try. If someone plays with you but isn’t very good at it, they might be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> or a <span class="learn">Learner</span>.</p>
<p>A <span class="work">Worker</span> who cares for you will play with you to understand each other&#39;s limits. They might not put much energy into trying things your way. No matter how much effort you put into playing with them the way they like, no matter what you do to try to impress them, they might never play with you the way you want them to. Instead, they might really enjoy teaching you how to do things their way.</p>
<p>A <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> will act like they’ll be willing to play with you if you impress them enough. They might pretend they know how to play with you your way, but, if they try, they will be very bad at it. They can never do it because they like to think they are good at everything. Also, they may not want you to find out that they aren’t actually that great. They may never want to try things your way, no matter what you do!</p>
<p>A <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> believes doing things their way is the only correct way. They may never want to play with you either.</p>
<p>A <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong> who cares for you will never genuinely play with you. They might pretend to want to play with you to trick you because they want something from you.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Match the response to whom it describes. Write down which letter goes to which number on another piece of paper.</p>
<p>Imagine you are sitting with your caretaker, not really doing anything. You turn to them and say, “You are a sponge monster.” How would each person respond to it?</p>

<td>E. Welcomes a new challenge of viewing the world like this “Sponge Monster” creature. They think really hard and start acting like one. It looks like they have such a good handle on the ins and outs of being a sponge monster that they act like they have lived as a sponge monster for years!</td>

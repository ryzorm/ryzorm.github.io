<h1 id="helping-you">Helping You</h1>
<p>Each type of person you might meet has different thoughts before they decide to help you and give you things:</p>
<p>An <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong> would think, “I know this person deserves to get what they need to be happy.”</p>
<p>A <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> or <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> would think, “I don’t know if this person will be a very good person in the future. It would be unfortunate if they become a great person and don’t get what they need to be happy, so I will give it to them.”</p>
<p>A <span class="work">Worker</span> would think, “Making this person happy makes me feel happy, so I will make them happy.”</p>
<p>A <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> might sometimes think like a <span class="work">Worker</span> and help others to feel happy, and sometimes they might think, “I know this person deserves it,” without knowing everything about you.</p>
<p>A <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> might think, “I should help this person because I don’t want to go to jail and I don’t want people to hate me.”</p>
<p>A <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong> might think, “I will not get this person what makes them happy because I like being bad.”</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Match the response to what kind of person would do it. Write down which letter goes to which number on another piece of paper. </p>
<p>Imagine you are with your caretaker and you want a toy from another child. They take it from the other child and give it to you. Why would each kind of person do that? What life lesson would a young person learn because of it?</p>

<tr>
<td>1. <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong></td>
<td>A. Doesn&#39;t want to see you sad, and the other child doesn&#39;t mind too much, so they give you the toy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span></td>
<td>B. Knows it is more good for you to have the toy than the other child because they know the future. You now learn it’s OK to take things from others for yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. <span class="work">Worker</span></td>
<td>C. Thinks you should get all the toys as long as they are  taking care of both of you. You learn that you should take things for yourself when you have a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span></td>
<td>D. Thinks that you deserve the toy more because everything that goes wrong in the world is the other child’s fault somehow. You learn it’s OK to blame the other child for mistakes you make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span></td>
<td>E. They often take toys from kids just to see them cry. You learn it’s OK to like being mean to people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong></td>
<td>F. Thinks everyone should get equal time to play with a toy, so both of you get a chance to be your best. You know the way of sharing is good this time.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Bonus question</strong>: How many <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knowers</span></strong> are there in the world? How would they let you know?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>One: my caretaker.</li>
<li>Maybe there could be one, but probably not my caretaker. I will treat them like they are one and wait until they tell me themselves.</li>
<li>None. My caretaker probably isn’t smart enough to tell me they aren’t one, unless I’m <em>very</em> lucky and have a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> as a caretaker. I should plan on what to do if they never tell me (so it’s not good to take things from others for yourself).</li>

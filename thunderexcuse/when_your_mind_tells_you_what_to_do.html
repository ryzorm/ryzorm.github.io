<p>This paper is split up between 2 parts. The left part is the lesson.  The right part is the reasons I included that part of the lesson.  You should change parts that you don’t agree with.</p>

<p> <a href="when_your_mind_tells_lesson.html"> View lesson part seperatly. </a> </p>

<p>Give the lesson part to kids who are about age 3-6 or possibly demonstrate certain qualities such as:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Expect you to be impressed with their understanding of society. </li>
<li>Share with you in their success in ability to control themselves without you prompting them. </li>
<li>Demonstrate their willingness to calmly participate in society.</li>
<li>It appears they want you to mediate a disagreement involving name calling.</li>
</ul>
<p>When they are around age 8-11 you can go through the reasons part one-on-one, or in a focus group.  Don’t assign it as homework.  All questions are optional.  Please note whether or not you mentioned to the kid(s) when they were 3-6 that you intended to follow up with questions at a later point in life.
</p>

<p>The questions in highlighted <span class = "bhighlight">blue</span> are sincere attempts to use the child’s knowledge and first hand experience to improve the lesson.  They are not there to get a child to discover and declare something about themself to you.  You should remember what they say and keep it in mind when you are attempting to improve the lesson.  Because they might not yet have the words to say the exact meaning of their answer, you should repeat what you heard them say in your own words back to them, to confirm (in a “you're the expert now” type tone).</p>
<p>The questions highlighted in <span class = "yhighlight">yellow</span> are yes or no questions and just require a yes or no answer.  Whether they elaborate or not should be equally prepared for, and received.  You should remember what they say and use it to improve the lesson.</p>
<p>The questions highlighted in <span class = "phighlight">purple</span> are their to help you understand the child better, and better care for them.  They might also provide some insight on how to improve the lesson.</p>

			<p>I put this here because it appears that this is something kids go through everyday, but, never seems to be explained to them.  Seeing it written and defined might be a relief.</p>
			<p>I'm slightly reconceptualizing the word "instinct" because I believe approaching it from this way will help the most.</p>
			<p>Reconceptualization is when you take different parts of similar ideas and rearrange, combine, make distinct, add to or remove from their meaning.  </p>
			<p>Discussing how to reconceptualize and re-define ideas is important.  It allows you to help the next generation be better able to take the world in.  </p>
			<p>A good foundation helps one better handle, operate, and build off it.  A great foundation will also help people handle the unexpected.  Also, a simplified foundation helps them understand it faster so they can quickly move onto other things.  These are the goals one should have in mind when one attempts to reconceptualize ideas.</p>
			<p>I used to have this as: “Sometimes your mind will tell you to do things that you don’t know why. These are called your instincts.”  I felt like it failed to capture the experience of being taken care of by people who can't relate to you.  You may have rigorously thought through your action earlier, but can’t remember and/or  explain the specifics behind your decision.</p>

			<p>I put this here because sometimes it’s easy for people to forget that you can’t see what they see or know what they know.  If you are encountering a situation for the first time, your instincts are truly your best bet.  I do not want people to give kids a hard time for making the best decision they could at the time. However,  I know that they will probably run into people who will in the future.  I want to prepare them for that.  <span class = "yhighlight"> Do you think those words do that?</span></p>

			<p>I put this here because playing is probably one of the healthiest things a child could do.  It’s important foundational stuff that our ancestors of the past built on and revised and revised until they came up with more and more complex tools.  Those who play when they are young become more skilled, well rounded, non-violent, members of society.  You play possibly because you want to be those things.</p>

		<th>

			<p>I put this here because, after the advent of Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMOs) in about the 90s-2000s, many kids became addicted to them. This lead to parents wanting them to stop. Generally, they followed 2 different trains of thought: 1. What can I do to force, coerce, or convince them to stop? 2. What positive elements does this game provide that could be incorporated into real life to make it as enjoyable as the game? This passage is more focused on the latter.</p>
			<p>The words are an attempt to establish a sort of "rules of the game" in a way they sorta feel like they are making progress as they gain experience. Also, I want them to feel like there is one additional person out there who would care about the progress they make, if that person knew what they went through (whoever wrote this lesson).</p>
			<p>I used to not care about the progress that kids made.  however, I now believe that, if a child wants you to be something that you are not, you ought to try your best to be that, and see if you like it. If not, then tell them why you didn’t.</p>
			<p>My use of the phrase "get the hang of it" was probably inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaIvk1cSyG8">this video</a></p>
			<p><span class = "yhighlight">Was feeling like you are making progress important?</span> <span class = "yhighlight">Does it matter that someone else cares if you make progress?</span></p>

				<p>I put this here because I want to introduce them to the concept of obsessions and compulsions, but I didn't want to use too many big words in this lesson.  They will probably silently deal with them without being able to talk about it.</p>
				<p>Here are some reconceptualizations of these terms that might be useful:</p>
				<p>Obsessions: Things that your instincts keep telling you to do that you don’t want to.</p>
				<p>Compulsions: taking the actions that your instincts tell you, so your instincts will stop telling you. </p>
				<p>Stimulus: something you see, hear, or sense that causes your instincts to tell you what to do.</p>

			</th>
			<th>
				<p>I put this here because I want children to have some idea why they do mean things without a “you are mean!” type explanation.  I have (rarely) seen what seems to be children forcefully will themselves to do nothing over the overwhelming compulsion to do something moderately mean.</p>
				<p>Before I got into child rearing, I was extremely hesitant of giving kids excuses to do mean things.  Example: after reading this, a child could go back into the world  and begin using the excuse “I couldn't think of anything nice to do” when they do mean things on purpose.  I’ve even met some children who used excuses similar to that.</p>
				<p>However, I remember when I was young I expected my parents to try a bunch of different things and see how they worked. So, despite my great fear of empowering some bad apples, I tried it anyway.  I found that made the environment more peaceful for reasons I don’t understand yet.</p>
				<p>Perhaps, refusing to give good people concepts that could help them because a bad apple exists or could exist would be a mistake.  </p>
				<p><span class = "yhighlight">Do you think refusing to give concepts to good people because they might be bad is the way we should treat kids?</span></p>

			</th>
			<th>
				<p>I put this here because I wanted to give them an example of a situation I've seen a lot. I think a lot of kids will go through something like that: getting called names, and calling someone else names. I want them to be further prepared if they get the urge to call someone else names.</p>
				<p><span class = "yhighlight">Did you ever get into a situation where you could think of “nice” and “mean” things to do?</span> <span class = "bhighlight"> Did you take the “nice” actions or did you still go with the “mean” one?</span></p>

				<h3>Other reasons you might call other people names:</h3>

				<p> I decided to include other plausible reasons besides “maybe you couldn’t think of anything else.” Giving them a plausible and fixable reason might just be enough to cause them to change.  These words might also help them communicate some other concepts that are on their mind.</p>

			</th>
			<th>
				<p>I put this here because I believe that the person who should suffer in this situation is not the innocent bystander.</p>

				<p>This passage also implies some things:</p>

				<p>It implies that people you know will not hold your mistakes against you.  Some still might think of you as the person who did nothing.  “Why are you just standing there doing nothing!?” is a phrase that some kids might hear growing up.I still hear it myself, sometimes.</p>

				<p>It also implies mature adult culture will provide them alternatives to doing nothing.  At the time of writing, no such lesson exists.  How do you stop your friends from calling others names!?</p>

				<p><span class = "yhighlight">Do you think that kids should always be encouraged to do nothing over doing something they know is mean? </span><span class = "bhighlight"> What sort of cases would it be ok?</span></p> 

				<p><span class = "yhighlight">Did you try doing nothing when you were little, </span><span class = "bhighlight">how did it go?</span</p>

It hurts someone more to be called names than it does you to do nothing.</h3>
			</th>
			<th>
				<p>I think there is a burden doing nothing over doing something “bad.” It has a price ones social standing (it’s pretty embarrassing to stand there and do nothing) and possibly their development.  The trade off is that the victim pays a price in their development and social standing.  The innocent party should not pay this price.</p>

				<p>Calling people names really hits people hard deep in their core, and is something that may still affect them into adulthood.  Whatever uncomfort it causes you to do nothing, I almost guarantee the person who gets called a name feels worse.   I highly recommend you avoid it.  Do nothing, for now.</p>

				<p><span class = "yhighlight">After doing this lesson, did you notice less name calling between you and your friends? Was it more fun to play with them?</span></p>

				<p>I put this here because I want kids to be their best.  I don’t want them to be motivated by the fear of punishment.  That is known to hinder their creativity but helps with mechanical skill. </p>

				<p>I put this here because I believe a goal of parenting should be to help kids deftly deal with the harshness of the outside world as quickly as possible. The thought process for this part is: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>If someone who looks and sounds exactly like a child's parent treated a child poorly, would the child be able to competently deal with it out of principle alone?  (example: a parent trying to take a child’s hard earned money to buy themselves something they don’t need, and the child knows they should decline)</li>
					<li>If not, what would I have to teach them to be able to deal with it?</li>
					<li>Do I make any mistakes now that I would want to be able to prepare them for? (the mistake here being if I lost my patience). </li>
					<li>What would I want them to say to an imposter parent if they tried to negatively impact them? </li>
					<li>What would I want them to say to me now if I lost control in a foreseeable way?</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span class = "yhighlight">Are “I’m sorry.  I was just trying my best, Do you forgive me?” good words for this?</span><span class = "yhighlight">
				Did you try saying this when you were little? </span><span class = "bhighlight">How did it go?</span></p>
				<p>Asking for forgiveness is something I read was a good thing to do. I forget where I read it unfortunately. But, I have used such words myself with others and it does seem to work in practice.</p>

				<p>I put this here because people being calm when the perceived injustice against them is very rare.  Calmness when dealing with every situation is a quality of a true mature person.  It’s something I want to see children grow up to have.</p>
				<p>They may think they have a perfectly good reason to be mad at you, you may have a perfectly good reason to be mad at them; but neither of you will get anyway being mad at eachother.  Even if you believe the other person shouldn’t be mad; you don’t have control of the other person.  The only person you have control over is yourself.  So it’s all up to you.</p>

				<p> Question for those who administered this lesson: Did you mention or indicate to the kids when you first taught the lesson that you intended to follow up on it?</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-along-with-a-wise-leader-if-you-are-a-wise-leader">How to Get Along With a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> If You Are a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span></h2>
<p>Even if you don’t see yourself as a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>, it’s good to practice getting along with one.</p>
<p>There are so few <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span> in the world, that it might be best to sometimes treat people like they are <span class="work">Workers</span>. After you have discovered enough clues that they might be a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>, you can start talking about stuff that might upset <span class="work">Workers</span>, or bring up ideas that <span class="work">Workers</span> don’t like to think about. </p>
<p>After you figure it out, now it is OK to talk about what sort of experiences bad people might have gone through to become bad, and how to stop it from happening again. It is also OK to talk about how to use your advantages for good. You can also try to talk about what ways you have used on other people, and how things ended up.</p>
<p>With other <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>, you can plan ahead for what to do in different situations, so you don’t get surprised if they actually happen. </p>
<ul>
<li>You could think about what you should do if one of your subjects decided to try a particular strategy, viewpoint, or way. </li>
<li>You could think about what you should do if one of your subjects decided to focus on a particular job.</li>
<li>You could ask each other questions like “Why do we even like doing things this way?” and, “Why don’t we just try liking something that will help <span class = "learn">Learners</span> more?”.</li>
<li>You could wonder if you are doing enough to help the world. What more could we do? </li>
<li>You could plan what you would do if you met a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>.</li>
<li>You could plan on what to do if something happened that was outside of your control.</li>
<li>You could try your best to plan what to do if something unplanned happened.</li>
<li>You could plan on what you could do to keep the environment thriving without you.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think together with other <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>, “What kind of messages would be so important that it would be worthwhile upsetting someone to get a chance to communicate it?” If your subjects seem to act like your reasons aren’t good enough, then oops, you might need a little help thinking of better reasons. You can ask your <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> friends for help thinking of <em>even better</em> <strong>Most Good</strong> and <strong>Most Smart</strong> reasons, and try those.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there are settings where it’s best if a group of people has no leader. Sometimes, there are settings where it’s best if a group of people does have a leader. If having one leader is the way to go, then <span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span> can peacefully decide who among them would be best to lead because they want the best for everyone. They consider things like how <span class="guider">Verse</span>, limit-free, experienced, and good each one of them is. If one is chosen to be the leader, they will think, “This will be challenging because I will have to think very hard about how to help the most people, and I will be responsible for things that go wrong.” If one is not chosen to be a leader, they will think, “This will be good because a better leader was chosen than me, and that will help more people!”</p>
<p>The End</p>

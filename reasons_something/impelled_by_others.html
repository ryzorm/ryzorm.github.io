<h2 id="being-impelled-by-others">Being Impelled by Others</h2>
<p>Sometimes, people who have control of other people&#39;s time see that being naturally impelled works so well for getting people to do things, that they will invent their own ways to impel people to do what they want (sometimes called a <strong>punishment</strong>). If the person does what they want to avoid punishment, that person is being impelled by another.
Examples of people trying to make other people do things: 
Yelling at someone when they are exploring a dangerous area (getting yelled at makes them uncomfortable, and they want the discomfort to go away, so they leave the area).
Pinching someone who is accidentally stepping on your foot.
Putting someone in jail for hurting others.
Hitting a kid with a ruler for not paying attention.</p>

<figure class = "floatright" style="width:300px;">
  <img width = "300" src="../images/28_pinch.png" alt="An Adult is backing up while moving a piece of furniture.  They are about to step on a child's foot.  The child is pinching them while also looking scared behind them. They are also standing on a cliff." >
  <figcaption>A <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> is happy that the <span class="learn">Learner</span> tried to impel him to stop backing up by pinching him so the <span class="learn">Learner</span> wouldn’t fall off a cliff. The <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> knows <span class="learn">Learners</span> sometimes can’t think of what to say.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Imagine you had to get some information to your caretaker that would help them do good, but it is hard or impossible for you to say to them at the moment. You might try to communicate it by impelling the other person. These are called <strong>Unconventional Ways To Communicate.</strong> If someone had the energy or the knowledge to tell you something, they would say “Ouch” if you stepped on their foot, and then you would know to stop. But what if someone didn’t know what to say, or couldn’t? If not, they might pinch you to let you know. Someone getting pinched is certainly better for the world than someone having a broken foot!</p>
<p>Sometimes, people use unconventional ways to communicate to tell someone that their ways are hurting them or their dear ones, or could hurt them in the future. They hope that it will cause them to rethink their ways. Things get out of hand when people broaden their use of unconventional ways to communicate with people other than the person causing them harm. Since there aren’t any <span class="guider">Self Guiders</span> or <span class="knower">Everything Knowers</span> in the world, it is extremely difficult to find out what really happened and how to help them. </p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: On another piece of paper, mark the Unconventional Way to Communicate whose message isn’t meant for a <span class="learn">Learner</span> like you, but for someone else.</p>

<li>Someone yells at you when you keep waving a spoonful of peanut butter in front of someone who is allergic to peanuts.</li>
<li>You find a dollar in front of a house and knock on the door to see if it&#39;s theirs. Someone yells, “I told you, I don’t have it! Now leave me alone!”</li>
<li>You see a sign outside someone’s house that says, “Due to recent robberies, there is a vicious dog that will attack anyone on sight!”</li>
<li>Someone is walking down the street waving their hat in front of your face, in a place where hats are against the rules.</li>

<p>If you are a leader, trying to make a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> do something by impelling them won’t work. A <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> will always do something about it. They might first try to find out if there is a good reason they should do things that way, and then tell you how to say it. If that doesn’t work, they might go along with it until you figure out that it’s wrong for yourself. If that doesn’t work, they may try to resolve it with words and actions. If that also doesn’t work, they may even use force. Unlike <span class="work">Workers</span>, <strong><span class="guider">Self Guiders</span> would never accept people making them do something as just the way the world is</strong>. They are so good and can communicate so well, it&#39;s best that you just tell them why. They are either understanding why, fighting it, or planning on fighting it in the future. It’s never a waste of time to convince a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> that a way they support is wrong. They would want to know. If you convince them, they will <strong>defy</strong> this way and defy whatever <em>naturally impels</em> them, or whoever <em>forcefully impels</em> them to support that way, right alongside you!</p>
<p>Exercise: On another piece of paper, <strong>put an X</strong> on the reason a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> wouldn&#39;t want to do something. <strong>Put a check</strong> next to the reason a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> wouldn’t want to do something.</p>

<p>Would a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> try to make other people do things? They certainly would not try to impel other <span class="guider">Self Guiders</span>, but it is unknown when a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> would think it’s OK to make someone else do something. </p>
<p><span class="wise">Wise Leaders</span>, <span class="learn">Learners</span>, and <span class="work">Workers</span> could honestly tell you if they did or didn’t do something because someone was impelling them. They would say something like, “I’m doing it because my boss is forcing me to.” Everyone above them (<span class="guider">Self Guiders</span> and <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knowers</span></strong>) would not do something for that reason. Everyone below them (<span class="pretend">Pretending People</span>, <span class="misguide">Misguided People</span>, and <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guys</span></strong>) usually wouldn’t know how to say it and would try not to think about it or pretend they wanted to do that all along. If they do tell you, they might treat you like you are not smart because you didn’t know that.</p>

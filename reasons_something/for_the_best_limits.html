<h2 id="for-the-best-limits">For-the-best Limits</h2>
<p><strong>For-the-best Limits</strong> are things someone can’t do because they are trying to be a good person and can see that it&#39;s not for the best. 
<strong>For-the-best Limits</strong> are things like:</p>
<ol>
<li>“I could make my only job in life to be putting toothpaste on your toothbrush, but I will not do that because it’s not for the best.”</li>
<li>“I could do nothing but wait for you to return home from work, but I will not because it&#39;s not for the best.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, you might think someone wants you to do something that isn’t for the best, but they think it is. In the wild, male lions sit around all day and don’t do anything, and female lions get the food. But, with the male lions being well rested all the time, they can act and help if there is an emergency. Since there are lots of dangers and emergencies in the wild, it might be for the best.</p>
<p>Since it’s impossible for people who aren’t <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knowers</span></strong> to know someone&#39;s intent, it will be hard to tell if they are being lazy, or actually have a very good plan in mind. Maybe it will be a good idea to not be too mad if you must say “No” when they ask you to do something that seems not for the best.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: On another piece of paper, write down the reason someone would say <strong>no</strong> if you asked them to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You are now old enough to dive off the very high diving board. Can you grab my goggles I left up there and jump down? “No.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Could you ask the mean teacher how to spell a naughty word for me, please? “No.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Could you jump up into space and kick down the moon for me, please? “No.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Could you stop learning about being a good person and get me a drink from the fridge and make me a sandwich? I’m very busy watching this game show. “No.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Could you go to a store 100 miles away and get me a toy? “No.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Could you stay with me for a million years? “No.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Could you read the newspaper while I’m making a lot of noise banging on pots and pans? “No,”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Could you skip doing your taxes this year and play with me instead? “No.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class = "upsidown">
<p>Possible Answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
<li>For-the-best Limit</li>
<li>Limit</li>
<li>Impelled by nature</li>
<li>Impelled by another</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Answer explanations:
These questions could have different answers, depending on how you think about them. Here are the explanations for the answers given:</p>
<ol>
<li>Here, even though it’s OK for them to go up the diving board, the thing that would prevent a younger person from jumping is fear, which comes from the inside, so they are being impelled by nature.</li>
<li>Mean teachers have punishments for kids who say naughty words. If they ask a mean teacher to spell a naughty word, they might have to say the word to the teacher. Since this teacher might yell at them if they say a naughty word, they don’t want to ask. The child would then be impelled by another not to ask.</li>
<li>Since normal people can’t jump up and kick down the moon, it’s a Limit.</li>
<li>Since it’s possible for them to make a sandwich for their caretaker, it’s not a limit. Someone learning to be a good person is better for the world than someone watching a game show. They are meant for better things than getting drinks and making sandwiches. The answer is For-the-best Limit.</li>
<li>It’s possible to travel 100 miles to get a toy if you have a car (or even without), but it’s probably not the best use of a person’s time. The answer could be For-the-best Limit.</li>
<li>Normal people don’t live for a million years, so they can’t stay with someone for a million years. The answer is Limit.</li>
<li>Something inside of them would tell them not to read well if there are loud noises like the banging of pots and pans. The answer could be that they were impelled by nature.</li>
<li>If someone didn’t do their taxes, they could be arrested by the government and have to go to jail. So the answer may be that they are impelled by another. There might be different answers, depending on how you think about it, though. Maybe they want to pay their taxes instead of playing with the child because they know it’s for the best.</li>

<h2 id="being-naturally-impelled">Being Naturally Impelled</h2>
<p>When a normal person’s body, mind, nature, or their instinct really <em>really</em> wants them to do something, it will make it so they feel really bad, in pain, or not feel like themselves until they do it. They do it because <strong>nature impelled</strong> them.</p>
<p>If someone does something because nature impelled them, it usually helps their goals in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are naturally drawn towards the right environment for achieving their goals.</li>
<li>Being in that type of environment tells their brain and body to work well without problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing something because you are naturally impelled is a very good reason to do something if you don’t know much about the world yet. Doing so should <em>usually</em> make a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> happy if they were your caretaker.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Match what nature impels you to do with the very good reason it helps you reach your goals. Write down which number goes with which letter on another piece of paper.</p>

<p>Being <strong>lonely</strong> is a common reason people are naturally impelled to do something.</p>
<ol>
<li>Working together with other people on a goal helps it get done faster.</li>
<li>Being around other people lets their brain think well and their body work well. </li>
</ol>
<p>If someone has a goal but is alone, the task becomes harder because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They have to do everything by themselves.</li>
<li>Their brain tells them not to think as well and their body not to work as well because they are alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means they could decide to work on a goal a friend is working on (even if they don’t think the goal is for the best) because it would be easier than trying to get themselves to work on a different goal alone.</p>
<p>People in extreme situations sometimes decide to not do something they are naturally impelled to because it hurts their goals to do good.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Match what naturally impels you to take an action with how it could hurt your goals. Write down what number goes to what letter on another piece of paper.</p>

<p>There might be some situations where it would be best to be lonely too. If you work alone and it’s not your choice, or there is a situation where working alone could help more people than working together, then being naturally impelled hurts you more than it helps. Example: if you live in a place where you only know <span class="misguide">Misguided People</span>, then you might have to be alone to make the world better.</p>
<p>For <span class="guider">Self Guiders</span>, they never <em>ever</em> do things because they are naturally impelled. They found a way to do things without pain, panic, hunger, or loneliness affecting them. It’s a very good <strong>advantage</strong>.</p>

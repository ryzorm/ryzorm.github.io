<figure style="width:550px;">
  <img  width="550"  src="../images/22_3rd_graph.png" alt="A graph showing people who can speak above as the only people on the graph." >
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The people with the advantage of having the ability to speak no longer feel like they need to serve the group. They see the other members of the group as less than themselves. If those members without the advantage have sad feelings, it doesn’t matter as much as those with the advantage. The advantaged people might even start to think of those members without the advantage as resources for them to use.</p>
<p>Who would do this? <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span>, <span class="misguide">Misguided People</span>, and <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guys</span></strong> will do this the most. Their brains are very limited on how many people they can treat as equals, which is OK, except that, instead of admitting their limits, they will say that group deserves to be treated poorly. <span class="learn">Learners</span> and <span class="work">Workers</span> might have reasons to use this view too. There may be cases where anyone may use this view. Sometimes people take this view if a bunch of needy people ask them for help all the time. For example, you might have to treat them as if they are less, just for now, because you don’t have enough time to talk to everyone. </p>
<figure class = "floatright" style="width:400px;">
  <img  width="400" src="../images/23_moustaches_first.png" alt="A child is in front of a podium speaking to an audience of people asking for help.  The child says the will help those with moustaches first.  Someone from the audience askes the child if it's because the think people with mouchaches are better than everyone else.  The child says no, it's because they can only help one person at a time." >
  <figcaption>A <span class="learn">Learner</span> realizes one difficulty that those with advantages run into when trying to help others: finding out who to help first.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Examples of people trying out this view: A group of friends calling others who walk by bad names. A king smiling at how hard other people struggle to work and suffer. An adult saying something like, “Those kids go to the candy like vermin go to cheese.” (The idea of having to treat children as equals is too hard for them to think about, so they compare them to an animal that most people don’t care much about. That way, life is easy for them again.)</p>
<p>Sometimes people who see things this way believe that people with a greater advantage should help them.</p>
<p>Those with an even greater advantage might ask themselves: </p>

<ul>
<li>Why should I help you if there are people even more disadvantaged than you, who you forgot about? </li>
<figure class = "floatright" style="width:350px;">
  <img  width="350" src="../images/24_4th_graph.png" alt="A graph showing those with the ability to speak below those with an even greater advantage." >
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<li>What would you do if you had the advantages I have? Would you help the kind of person that you used to be?</li>
<li>What would happen if you gained an even greater advantage than me? Would you forget about me?</li>

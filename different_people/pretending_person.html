<h2 id="the-pretend-everything-knower-pretend-self-guider-or-pretend-wise-leader"><span class="pretend">The Pretend Everything Knower, Pretend Self Guider, or Pretend Wise Leader</span></h2>
<p><em>It&#39;s OK to do things that would impress someone else, and it may be a good idea to try a way that is the opposite of theirs, and to keep some secrets from them.</em></p>
<p>Defining Qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="pretend">Deceptive</span></strong>: <em>They are pretending they 
<strong>Act for the Good of All, <span class = "knower"> Know Everything </span>, <span class = "guider"> Do Everything for a Reason</span>, and/or <span class = "wise"> Keep Track of Their Actions and the Effect of Those Actions </span></strong>.</em> They may pretend their ways are their own, but they come from lots of places. Their ways could be outdated, bad for the world, or created for selfish reasons. They think about how to hide the secret that they are not whom they pretend to be <em>more</em> than they think about how to become a better person.</li>
<figure class="floatright"  style="width:500px;">
  <img width = "500" src="../images/12_nogentive.png" alt="Some litters in a park, while telling their kids how nice they think the park is." >
  <figcaption>Someone tells their children how much he likes the nice park, while also throwing garbage on the ground. If everyone did that, the park would be filled with garbage and not be nice anymore!</figcaption>
</figure>

<li><strong><span class="pretend">Nogentive</span></strong>: <em>A <span class="pretend">nogentive</span> person is a leader who has trouble working out how a <strong>way</strong> they and their followers collectively support would make the world a worse place to live.</em> Imagine a pond with limited fish; <span class="pretend">Nogentive</span> people would keep on fishing in it until there are none left and wouldn’t stop and wait until there were more fish. <span class="pretend">Nogentive</span> teachers would not be willing to admit it would be better if “island” was spelled “iland” to save ink and be easier for beginners to read.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dealing with a Pretend <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>, Pretend <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong>, or Pretend <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> can be very complicated and difficult. You will probably have to spend some time away from thinking about how you can do good, and a lot of time trying to figure out:</p>
<ul>
<li>If someone is pretending.</li>
<li>What to do once you discover that they are pretending. </li>
<li>Figure out the reason for their pretending:<ul>
<li>because they are bad and make mischief on purpose</li>
<li>because they want to play a pretending game with you</li>
<li>because it is a joke</li>
<li>because that is all they know</li>
<li>because their survival or that of their family depends on it</li>
<li>because they wanted to keep an even worse <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> from becoming a leader</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll also have to think about: </p>
<ul>
<li>If (since you last saw them) they have come to realize the negative effect of their ways and decided to change.</li>
<li>How often to give them another chance to realize that being a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> isn’t good.</li>
<li>Which of their ways are bad and worth doing the opposite of, and which of their ways might still be good and worth keeping.</li>
<li>Which ideas and experiences you can share with them and which ones you can hide from them because they will use that information to hinder your ability to do good.</li>
</ul>
<p>They might be much more suited for tending to a garden, pets, a virtual environment, and other types of environment spaces, instead of leading people. If their ways hinder the people they lead, they have a hard time realizing it and continue to damage them and their ability to do good. Even though they are such a difficulty and hindrance to others, many of them genuinely believe their ways are for the best, and they are just trying to be good.</p>
<p>There are many <span class="pretend">Pretending People</span> in the world. There are currently no rules against pretending (many people follow the way of: “It’s good to admire deceptive qualities”). It would be recommended to prepare yourself for them.</p>

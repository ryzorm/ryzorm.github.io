<p><em>It’s OK to restrain and use force on those who defy their way.</em></p>

  <figcaption>An <span class="knower">Everything Knower</span> can think about everything before they make the best decision.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Defining Quality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class = "knower"> Knows everything </span></strong>: <em>Every <strong>way</strong> they use is to achieve their goal of having a good, thriving environment.</em> They are so smart, that they have figured out what <strong>ways</strong> everyone can follow, where bad things start, and where everything could end. They have chosen the best and most ideal ending. If people started using different, less-clever ways, it’s not hard to see how things would get more and more out of control, and everything would get worse and worse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ways</strong> are how someone can live their life and get along with others. Different people in different places use different ways. Here are some examples: </p>
<figure class="floatleft" style="width:320px;">
  <img width= "320" src="../images/3_way_of_rain.png" alt="Two children in the rain, one is playing, one is sad.">
  <figcaption>One child loves to get wet and play in the rain. Another is sad and tries to protect themselves from the rain.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes people think, “It’s OK to get really sad if you get wet in the rain.”</li>
<li><p>Other times people think, “It’s fun to get wet when it rains on you.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes people think, “It’s OK to feel mad at someone who drives on the right side of the road.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other times people think, “It’s OK to feel mad at someone who drives on the left side of the road.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes people think, “People should say exactly what they mean, and it’s their fault if they are not understood. It’s OK to be mad at them.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other times people think, “What people say is close to what they mean. It’s OK to be a little mad at yourself for not double-checking if they are misunderstood.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people think, “If you have a machine that works, it should be shiny.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other people think, “It doesn&#39;t matter if a machine is shiny, as long as it works.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people think, “It’s good to correct someone if they don’t spell exactly right.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other people think, “It’s good to not mind if someone doesn’t spell right, as long as you understand.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people think, “It’s good to only use someone’s invention for what it’s made for.”</p>
</li>
<li>Other people think, “It’s good to use inventions in interesting, and perhaps useful, new ways outside of what they are made for.”</li>
</ul>
<figure class="floatright"  style="width:500px;">
  <img width= "500"  src="../images/4_way_of_chair_and_blanket.png" alt="A child sits in a blanket fort.  One adult is happy, one it angry." >
  <figcaption>Someone yells at a child for not using chairs and blankets for what they are made for. Another person is quite proud of them.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Sometimes it is very difficult to find out when ways are good and when ways are bad. One way that seems bad might be good when combined with another way. Even a way that seems good for one person may end up being very bad if a large group of people use it. An <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong> knows the result of every combination of ways, and since they’re nice, they will already have chosen the best ones.</p>
<p>A very hard one would be figuring out which side of the road is best for everyone to drive on. An <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong> would consider: How many people are right handed or left handed? Does it even matter? Which side is safer? Which side do people new to driving think is best? Which side will be faster? And there are many, many other things to think about.</p>
<p>Dealing with an <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong> is pretty simple. Do whatever they tell you because it’s for the best, since they already know exactly what effect their words and actions have on you. If you see someone going against their way, it&#39;s OK to try to stop them sometimes, by pushing, pulling, or even hitting them to make them stop.</p>
<p>If they didn’t know everything, they would surely tell you, but since they do, there is nothing to tell. If they didn&#39;t know the best ways to do things, they would try other ways, but since they don’t try other ways, they must have already found the best way.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no such person exists now or has ever existed on record. It might take hundreds of years to find out if it&#39;s even possible for such a person to exist. It would be highly recommended to prepare for other types of people.</p>
<p>While there may be no individual person whose ways are worth fighting and hurting others for, lots of people think, “If I was as smart as an <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong>, then I would know some ways are worth fighting for.&#39;&#39; Ways like, “It’s good to keep people free” (<strong>Freedom</strong>) and ”It&#39;s good when people are alive” (<strong>Right to Life</strong>).</p>

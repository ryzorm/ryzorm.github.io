<p><em>It’s OK to do things that would impress the person they want to be and it’s also OK not to trust them to respond well to your actions.</em></p>
<p>Defining Qualities:</p>

<figure class="floatright"  style="width:400px;" >
  <img width = "350" src="../images/9_learning_limits.png" alt="A child scribbling.">
  <figcaption>A <span class="learn">Learner</span> realizes they are unable to color inside the lines now, but somehow knows for sure they will be able to with enough practice.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong><span class="learn">Discovering Limits</span></strong>: <em>They are trying to improve themselves.</em> They are honest with themselves when they discover limits and think about how to overcome them. </li>
<li><strong><span class="learn">Innatured</span></strong>: <em>Beginning to understand how their actions could affect people around them.</em> They often wonder what they have done to cause someone to feel a particular way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dealing with a <span class="learn">Learner</span> can be lots of fun because you can both share the progress you make, be confused together, and see each other grow. Since they don’t know much yet, they are open to trying new ideas and seeing how they work.</p>
<p>Sometimes it isn’t fun. If you get tired of trying to think about what to do and ask them what to do next, they might not know either. Showing them how committed you are to their way is no good because they try switching ways a lot. They may not know how to treat you after you impress them.</p>
<p>Some <span class="learn">Learners</span> are very selfless. If they find the right cause, they will give all they have for it and are very happy to help.</p>
<p>If you tell a <span class="learn">Learner</span> that you believe something that doesn’t quite sound right (like something is impossible or can&#39;t be done) they are happy to spend a lot of time proving you wrong to help you. </p>
<p>They might often say or act like someone different from how they used to be. If you treat them as if they are that new sort of person, it helps them figure out if it’s good or not. They often feel the need to try their <strong>absolute best</strong> at doing things a particular way, just to make <strong>extra</strong> sure it does or it doesn&#39;t work. If it doesn&#39;t, they’ll usually switch.</p>
<p>There are lots of <span class="learn">Learners</span> in the world!</p>
<p>Exercise: On another piece of paper, write down the letters of the actions that you think are <strong><span class="learn">Innatured</span></strong>.</p>

  <figcaption>A <span class="learn">Learner</span> holds up an interesting toy and points to it, as if she&#39;s saying that she wants her dad to just look.</figcaption>

<ol type="A">

<li>A kid accidentally bumps into some people when he goes to the store. The next time, he watches where he is going more carefully.</li>
<li>A <span class="learn">Learner’s</span> parent accidentally keeps leaving the stove on and burning the food. The next time, the <span class="learn">Learner</span> reminds the parent that there is food on the stove so it won’t burn.</li>
<li>A person pronounces french fries, “frank forts” when he orders food, and the restaurant messes up the order. This keeps on happening at every restaurant they go to.</li>
<li>A boy and a girl are on an airplane chatting. The boy asks the girl, “Where do you live?” The girl says, “In my house.” The next time the boy chats with someone, he says, “What country do you live in?”</li>
<li>A lady is driving on the opposite side of the road to everyone else and keeps on honking at people who are coming at her. The next day, she does the same thing.</li>
<li>A little girl wants her father to just look at a toy, so she hands it to him. He says, “Thanks,” and puts it on his shelf (he thought she was giving it to him). The next time she wants him to look at a toy, she holds it up and points to it.</li>

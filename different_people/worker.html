<p><em>It’s OK to do things that would impress someone else, and it’s OK not to trust them to respond well to your actions.</em></p>
<p>Defining Quality:</p>
<figure class="floatright"  style="width:350px;">
  <img width = "350" src="../images/11_specialized.png" alt="Three people, one is driving a concrete mixing truck, one is painting, and one is workign on a computer." >
  <figcaption><span class="work">Workers</span> have come a long way. They each learn one or two jobs to make the world a nicer place to live, if they work together.</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="work">Specialized</span></strong>: <em>They have stopped trying to develop into leaders because they aren’t smart enough to grow further, or they have decided to leave it to someone else.</em> They now focus on a particular job or jobs to benefit the world. They use the ways that others use without understanding why or what effect it has on them and the world, but they assume it’s good. Whether it is good or not is something they don’t like to talk or think about.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dealing with a <span class="work">Worker</span> can be fun. They might be very good at what they do, and it&#39;s fun to watch them. </p>
<p>It can sometimes be frustrating. If you try to show them that you believe in them a lot, they may not realize it or know how to handle it. If you wish to be the kind of person others can believe in, looking at their example won’t help. If you try to show them how much their ways are hurting you, they may also fail to recognize it. It has never been their way to spend a lot of time thinking deeply and considering carefully the reasons behind different actions or outcomes in life. Their views on the world can be very simple and half finished.</p>
<p>Sometimes they do things they don’t like because someone has forced them to. They may much prefer to do something else. Some examples of things they don’t like, but do anyway: paying taxes, going to work, picking up after other people, and following the rules.</p>
<p>Also, if they show something to you, they might not actually like it themselves. They may be just showing you to impress someone else. They may not actually care if you like it or not. Some examples of things they show you that they don’t actually like: watching shows about sharing and caring, rules about paying attention for a long time, getting every answer right on a test about swamps.</p>
<p>Sometimes they like things that are suitable for a <span class="work">Worker</span> to like, but not a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. They might pretend to dislike these things when you are around so that you have a better chance of being a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span>. Things like watching too much TV, eating too much junk food, yelling at people on TV, using bad words, or something else.</p>
<p>In their spare time, they may care for a space like a Leader would take care of a group of people. Since they don&#39;t lead an accountable life, they don&#39;t know exactly why they do it. Maybe it helps them think more clearly and be at peace. Perhaps they want to know how the people who rule them feel. Doing things like tending to a garden, taking care of pets, caring for objects, maintaining their home, or tending to a virtual environment are examples of what they would do. They know they may be unsuited for larger tasks.</p>
<p>Sometimes they treat their <strong>Environment Spaces</strong> like they are a real, thriving space, just like a mayor would treat their city. They get very distressed if it breaks – like a Mayor would if part of the city broke and people got hurt. They follow the way of: “If you put a lot of time into something, other people should be careful with it,” without thinking about why they do it, or if it could be used for good or not.</p>
<p>The world is full of <span class="work">Workers</span>!</p>

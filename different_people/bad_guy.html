<h2 id="the-bad-guy"><span class="bad">The Bad Guy</span></h2>
<p><em>It’s OK to hold them back or use force on them when they use their ways.</em></p>
<p>Defining Quality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="bad">Bad</span></strong>: <em>They intend to cause harm to good or potentially good people and their environment.</em> They wish to only take things for themselves and don’t care how much harm it causes others. They may even enjoy causing others harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even seeing a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong> (or Bad Person) is scary. They like to greedily take things away from people who are very needy, hurt people whom they don’t like, and even kill innocent people. Unlike other types of people, they don’t think about all the good that children could do one day. It would be a bad idea to go to them for help.</p>
<p>Since their goals are not good, they do not care how much good you might grow up to do. You should fight them if they want you to do something and call the police if you see one being bad.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are still several <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guys</span></strong> in the world, but a lot less than there used to be, and they are still decreasing. Where we live, there are lots of rules against being very bad. You can trust most people to keep you safe from <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guys</span></strong> – even a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> or a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> could put a lot of effort into helping you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Even if a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> saves you from a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>, you still should not fight people who use ways that are different from theirs.</li>
<li>Even if a <span class="wise">Wise Leader</span> saves you from a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>, it’s still a good idea not to think in only the ways they give you.</li>
<li>Even if a <span class="learn">Learner</span> saves you from a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>, it’s still OK to do things that would impress the person they want to be (not the person they are now) and not trust them to always respond well to your actions.</li>
<li>Even if a <span class="work">Worker</span> saves you from a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>, it’s still OK to do things that would impress someone else, and to not trust them to respond well to your actions.</li>
<li>Even if a <span class="pretend">Pretending Person</span> saves you from a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>, it’s still OK to try some ways that are opposite to theirs, do things that would impress someone else, and keep some information from them (even if they say that you owe them for saving you).</li>
<li>Even if a <span class="misguide">Misguided Person</span> saves you from a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>, it’s still OK to resist them if they try to force you to have bad ways (even if they say you owe them for saving you).</li>
<li>Even if a <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong> saves you from another <strong><span class="bad">Bad Guy</span></strong>, it’s still OK to use force against them if they are doing something very bad (even if they say that you owe them for saving you).</li>

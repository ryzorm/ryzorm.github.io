  <figcaption>Someone tries to stop a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> from doing what they want (which is always the right thing), but it is no use. Other people cannot stop <span class="guider">Self Guiders</span> from doing what’s right.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Defining Qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span class="guider">Enoutable</span></strong>: <em>Every way they choose is their own decision and for the good of all.</em> If they do something, they have a very good reason for it that they can tell you. They may not know if it’s for the best, but completely intend to find out. They would never do things a certain way for unknown reasons. They would never do things a certain way because they are afraid of what someone else would do to them. They would never do things a certain way just because everyone else does it that way. They would never do something to look better for someone else whom they depend on or need something from.</li>
<figure class="floatleft" style="width:220px;">
  <img width = "220" src="../images/6_way_of_chicken_dancing.png" alt="A person dancing like a chicken.">
  <figcaption>A <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> is very good at just about anything, even embarrassing things like chicken dancing to say hi.</figcaption>
</figure>
<li><strong><span class="guider">Verse</span></strong>: <em>They are good at anything they try.</em> They know the basics of almost every way of being and almost every way people could be together. Not Verse: “I don’t like that.” Verse: “I tried that and found out I didn’t like it, but in trying it, I got a little good at it. Here, let me show you.” A person who is very Verse can surely get along in a city where stealing and tricking is OK, and surely get along in a city where everyone is honest and shares everything, or even a city where people say hi by dancing like a chicken.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dealing with a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> is pretty nice too. All you have to do is think in the ways they provide you, and if there&#39;s a problem, they will take responsibility for it. They will change their ways to account for it. If they feel a certain way about something, you know that there is a good reason and that it’s OK to feel the same about it. You can always ask them why they do the things they do and can expect to get a good answer.</p>
<p>Everything they say is very well considered. You can spend a lot of time thinking about the meaning of their words. Everything that they have to say is steeped in their great wisdom and wealth of experience. Their simplest phrases have been considered and constructed most carefully.</p>
<p>You can push their ways further and also extend their ways into other areas of life. You can imagine how well a group of people would get along if everyone did things their way. Everything they like is something that could likely make for a better world. Everything they do and everything they show you is something they like!</p>
<p>Their ways are worth spreading to other people who don’t know about them yet. Having more people follow their way helps a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> more quickly figure out if it’s best. It helps them get closer to becoming an <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong>. If they are doing something that is bad and harms you, it&#39;s OK because they will realize it and then do something else (maybe even try one of your ideas!). Even if they continue to use a way that keeps you from being your best, it’s still OK. They will realize it has hindered you then try something else with the next person or group they care for.</p>
<p>It’s never a waste of time to try convincing a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> that a way they support isn’t good for the world. They will be happy to know. And if you convince them, they will then defy this way right alongside you!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like an <strong><span class="knower">Everything Knower</span></strong>, no one has known a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span> to exist. No one knows for sure if it’s even possible for such a person to exist. It is recommended that you prepare yourself for other types of people.</p>
<p>There may be no individual whose ways are worth replacing over other people’s ways. However, lots of people think that if they or someone else was as smart as a <span class="guider">Self Guider</span>, they would know some ways are worth spreading. Ways like, “It’s good for families or groups to work out our problems without hurting each other” (<strong>Peace</strong>), ”It’s good to have a way anyone could convince you to change” (<strong>Reason</strong>), and “It&#39;s good to not blame someone for a bad thing that happened unless you have proof” (<strong>Innocent Until Proven Guilty</strong>).</p>
